# Color classifier in Python scikit-learn

A simple excercise in machine learning through crowdsourcing data.

# Whats is all about?

The first part of the app is a page where you must pick a label to the randomly generated color.
Every answer is saved into database.
The second part is a machine learning part - after feeding the model enough data, you can start paying with it by
choosing any color and let the model guess its label, based on the data provided from the users.
